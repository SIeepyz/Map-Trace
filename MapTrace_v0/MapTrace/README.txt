Path Travelled Tracer
By: galaga49 | MoreOs#4958

How to use:

1. Locate userId of person you want the path of

2. Audit them

3. Locate the PathTraveled Tab

4. Figure out how much path you want to trace and open that many tabs
Remember the most recent tab is the 0 tab and new tabs are made somewhere between every 30-90s.
Generally a decent amount to check would be 25 tabs of points to get an idea of what they were recently doing.

5. Starting from the first entry BELOW PathTraveled if you're starting from 0 select until the final point below is the first 3 points for example

        0
        [2]
        0
        :
        17602
        1
        :
        786
        1
        [2]
        0
        :
        17602
        1
        :
        786
        2
        [2]
        0
        :
        17602
        1
        :
        786

6. Load the html file and go on the page

7. Copy the data you selected before and paste it into the input box on the html page

8. Press submit and then look at the map

If everything worked well congrats you now can see roughly where they were in that timeframe.

NOTES: 
    People who seem to clip corners/entirely through islands may just have fast boats and they went around it before the next snapshot was taken

    This should not be used as sole evidence for cases but supplementary information that should help you form your opinions but not decide them

    This map seems to be over 90% accurate in tracking their exact location mentioned in the PathTraveled nodes

    The path traced will start as a near-black color and shift towards a neon green color, the darker the color the older that segment of the path is

    This program is not tested for more than 100 sample points and could have unexpected behavior occur, in which case I'm not sure how much help can be offered
