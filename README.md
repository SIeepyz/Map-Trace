# Map-Trace by Galaga
Traces map based on data
## Instructions
Inside you will find one folder in which you'll see exactly 5 files:

One is an html file which when opened (through your browser) will open a web page that lets you run the program

Next is a javascript file that does all the magic, if you want to judge me and my poor habit of leaving unused variables around because I worked on this at like 4am check it out

Then theres a picture of the AO map, nothing interesting just used to be loaded on the page. 

Lastly two text files, one is a Read Me with instructions on how to use the program but also how I would advise using the tool to assist you (l'd suggest giving it a quick look through its not long)

The other is a set of sample data you can copy and paste into the program just to ensure things seem to be working for you.

If you have any questions within reason @ me and I can try to help you

Special Thanks for Waffle and Foxzo for introducing and helping Galaga with path travelled information.
Also thanks to waffle and foxzo for helping me out and introducing me to the path travelled stuff initially
